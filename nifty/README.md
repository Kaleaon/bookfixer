# Nifty Downloader

Install: download the ZIP from the [main page](../README.md), then in Calibre choose **Preferences → Plugins → Load plugin from file**, pick it, restart Calibre, and add its button under **Preferences → Toolbars & menus** if it is not visible. Calibre 6 or newer.

Built with `python build_plugins.py` from the repository root (see *Building and testing* on the [main page](../README.md)).

Stories are copyrighted by their authors, and the sites ask that they not be reposted, so this is meant for personal reading copies. Requests are throttled and run in a background thread with a Cancel button; whatever was fetched before a cancel is still imported. No cover is added (use Calibre's *Generate cover*).

Nifty is a plain directory tree (section / category / story or series folder) of mail-style text files, one per chapter, with no tags or summaries.

- **Download stories by address…**: paste a story file, a series folder, or a category folder. A link to any chapter downloads the whole series. A bare section (for example `/nifty/gay/`) is refused as too broad.
- **Browse by category…**: pick a section (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender) and a category, load its entries, filter by title, and tick what you want. **★ Toggle favorite** saves a category, and a *Favorite categories* drop-down jumps straight to one.
- **Browse by author…**: Nifty files one author's stories under many different category folders (in the gay section, 86% of authors have stories in two or more), and a series is often split across them. This view uses Nifty's authors directory to list *all* of an author's stories for the section you pick, wherever they are filed.
  - Sets that look like one series are suggested at the top, even when their parts sit in different folders: titles like `Texas Tails` / `Texas Tails: Jeremiah`, numbered titles like `The Beau Cycle 6`, `7`, `8`, and titles that extend another of the author's titles such as `Valley Boys` / `Valley Boys Rugby Tour`.
  - These are only suggestions. Tick a whole set, or untick any story that does not belong, and by default each ticked set becomes one book with a contents entry per story (turn that off to get separate books). You can also tick any stories at all and combine them into one book with a title you type, which is the way to gather an author's shared-universe stories that are not named alike.
  - The suggestion rule is deliberately cautious. It does not treat a shared opening phrase as a series (an author's habit such as `Night with Mark` / `Night with Mike` is not one), and it never treats alternate versions (`(Revised)`, `[Original]`, `redux`) as a series. It also cannot know about stories that are related only in the author's mind, so some real sets will not be suggested; on the real directory it suggests 38 sets for 35 authors.
  - Selections are per author: pick an author, tick, download, then pick the next.
- **Chapters are joined into one book**: files named `name-1`, `name-2`, … (also `chapter05`) are grouped and ordered numerically into one EPUB with a contents entry per chapter. One folder can hold several series; each becomes its own book. The combine option works here too.
- The hard-wrapped text is re-flowed into paragraphs; blocks that look like verse or lists keep their line breaks; `____`, `***` and `---` scene breaks become rules. A few old stories are HTML pages and are cleaned like Metabods text.
- Metadata comes from the mail headers: the title is the Subject with chapter markers and category lists removed, the author is the From name (the email address is dropped), the date becomes the publication date, and the section and category become tags. Publisher is *Nifty*; identifier is `nifty:<path>`.
- **Limits**: old files with no headers get the author *Unknown* and a title taken from the folder or file name. Odd or truncated Subject lines may leave an imperfect title. Nothing is added that the archive does not publish.
