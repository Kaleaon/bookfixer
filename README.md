# Takeout Book Fixer for Calibre

Install `dist/TakeoutBookFixer.zip` in Calibre 6 or newer using **Preferences → Plugins → Load plugin from file**, then restart Calibre. Add **Takeout Book Fixer** to the toolbar through **Preferences → Toolbars & menus** if needed.

Choose an individual book file, Google Takeout folder, or ZIP through the plugin menu, then select a separate output folder. Automatic import into the current Calibre library is enabled by default and can be unchecked. Originals remain untouched. Each run writes a JSON report listing recovered, skipped, and failed files. Content hashes keep output names distinct and avoid duplicate copies on repeated runs.

The plugin detects PDF, EPUB, MOBI, DjVu and ZIP comic containers from content rather than extensions. Existing `.cbr` files with RAR signatures are copied; other RAR files are skipped because a RAR signature alone cannot establish that the archive contains a comic. Unsupported files and metadata are skipped. DRM is not removed. EPUB recognition requires its standard mimetype and container entries; recognition does not validate the entire book.

Optional PDF conversion renders every page of a PDF with no detected word characters to an ordered CBZ. It preserves page appearance, including drawing and overlays, rather than pulling out embedded images that may omit page elements. It skips text-bearing PDFs. Scanned novels also qualify: enable this option only when you want such PDFs treated as comics. PDFs cannot become EPUBs by renaming; only actual EPUB containers mislabeled as PDF receive `.epub`.

PDF conversion requires **PyMuPDF** available to Calibre's Python runtime, or **Poppler** (`pdfinfo`, `pdftotext`, `pdftoppm`) on Calibre's PATH. Installing PyMuPDF in an unrelated system Python may not make it available to Calibre. Format recovery works without either. Conversion renders at approximately 144 DPI with PyMuPDF or a 2400-pixel maximum side with Poppler. Encrypted PDFs are not converted. Large batches may take time. Safety limits: 512 MiB per input/output file, 10 GiB input batch, 2000 PDF pages. The ZIP is read without extracting archive paths.

Build: `python build.py`. Test: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` (PDF tests require PyMuPDF). Verified with Calibre 9.15 on Linux: plugin installation, Qt menu creation, complete recovery/import action with automated dialogs, actual library format storage, embedded metadata and cover extraction, matching JSON sidecar metadata, duplicate skipping, and CBZ library import. PDF conversion and text protection also passed inside Calibre’s runtime using Poppler. Interactive file selection and other operating systems have not been tested.

The importer reads embedded book metadata and covers using Calibre. Matching JSON sidecars (`book.pdf.json` or `book.json` beside `book.pdf`) supplement title, authors, publisher, description, language, categories, publication date and ISBN, including Google Books `volumeInfo` objects. Missing titles fall back to the original filename. Unsupported sidecar layouts are not guessed. No online metadata lookup is performed. Identical formats with the same title are skipped on subsequent imports. The JSON report includes import results and Calibre book IDs.

## Real Takeout validation

Version 1.0.1 was tested with the shared January 2025 export part 003: all 51 books recovered and imported into Calibre 9.15 with no errors. Content inspection identified 47 EPUBs and four PDFs; 16 of those EPUBs had been named `.pdf`. Calibre recovered known authors for 48 books and covers for all 51. Takeout ZIPs are streamed per member, allowing the archive itself to exceed the individual-book size limit. Other parts of the export and the full October 2026 export were not validated.

Optional comic conversion was also verified with both real image-only PDFs (45 pages each): all pages rendered and both CBZs imported successfully. Both text-bearing PDFs stayed PDF. Lossless rendering took several minutes per comic in this environment.
