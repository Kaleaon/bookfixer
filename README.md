# Takeout Book Fixer for Calibre

Install `dist/TakeoutBookFixer.zip` in Calibre 6 or newer using **Preferences → Plugins → Load plugin from file**, then restart Calibre. Add **Takeout Book Fixer** to the toolbar through **Preferences → Toolbars & menus** if needed.

Choose an individual book file, Google Takeout folder, or ZIP through the plugin menu, then select a separate output folder. Automatic import into the current Calibre library is enabled by default and can be unchecked. Originals remain untouched. Each run writes a JSON report listing recovered, skipped, and failed files. Content hashes keep output names distinct and avoid duplicate copies on repeated runs.

The plugin detects PDF, EPUB, MOBI, DjVu and ZIP comic containers from content rather than extensions. Existing `.cbr` files with RAR signatures are copied; other RAR files are skipped because a RAR signature alone cannot establish that the archive contains a comic. Unsupported files and metadata are skipped. DRM is not removed. EPUB recognition requires its standard mimetype and container entries; recognition does not validate the entire book.

Optional PDF conversion renders every page of a PDF with no detected word characters to an ordered CBZ. It preserves page appearance, including drawing and overlays, rather than pulling out embedded images that may omit page elements. It skips text-bearing PDFs. Scanned novels also qualify: enable this option only when you want such PDFs treated as comics. PDFs cannot become EPUBs by renaming; only actual EPUB containers mislabeled as PDF receive `.epub`.

PDF conversion requires **PyMuPDF** available to Calibre's Python runtime, or **Poppler** (`pdfinfo`, `pdftotext`, `pdftoppm`) on Calibre's PATH. Installing PyMuPDF in an unrelated system Python may not make it available to Calibre. Format recovery works without either. Conversion renders at approximately 144 DPI with PyMuPDF or a 2400-pixel maximum side with Poppler. Encrypted PDFs are not converted. Large batches may take time. Safety limits: 512 MiB per input/output file, 10 GiB input batch, 2000 PDF pages. The ZIP is read without extracting archive paths.

Build: `python build.py`. Test: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` (PDF tests require PyMuPDF). Verified with Calibre 9.15 on Linux: plugin installation, Qt menu creation, complete recovery/import action with automated dialogs, actual library format storage, embedded metadata and cover extraction, matching JSON sidecar metadata, duplicate skipping, and CBZ library import. PDF conversion and text protection also passed inside Calibre’s runtime using Poppler. Interactive file selection and other operating systems have not been tested.

The importer reads embedded book metadata and covers using Calibre. Matching JSON sidecars (`book.pdf.json` or `book.json` beside `book.pdf`) supplement title, authors, publisher, description, language, categories, publication date and ISBN, including Google Books `volumeInfo` objects. Missing titles fall back to the original filename. Unsupported sidecar layouts are not guessed. No online metadata lookup is performed. Identical formats with the same title are skipped on subsequent imports. The JSON report includes import results and Calibre book IDs.

The plugin menu also includes **Repair selected books already in Calibre**. Select books in the library, choose that command, and it checks every stored format by signature. A mislabeled EPUB is saved as EPUB and the old format is removed only after the corrected format is safely stored. The optional PDF-to-CBZ conversion is available here too. Metadata is refreshed from the corrected file when Calibre can read it. Books with unknown content are left unchanged.

## Real Takeout validation

Version 1.0.1 was tested with the shared January 2025 export part 003: all 51 books recovered and imported into Calibre 9.15 with no errors. Content inspection identified 47 EPUBs and four PDFs; 16 of those EPUBs had been named `.pdf`. Calibre recovered known authors for 48 books and covers for all 51. Takeout ZIPs are streamed per member, allowing the archive itself to exceed the individual-book size limit. Other parts of the export and the full October 2026 export were not validated.

Optional comic conversion was also verified with both real image-only PDFs (45 pages each): all pages rendered and both CBZs imported successfully. Both text-bearing PDFs stayed PDF. Lossless rendering took several minutes per comic in this environment.

# Metabods Downloader for Calibre

Separate plugin: `dist/MetabodsDownloader.zip` (build with `python build_metabods.py`). Install through **Preferences → Plugins → Load plugin from file** and restart; add **Metabods** to a toolbar via **Preferences → Toolbars & menus** if needed. Calibre 6 or newer.

It builds EPUBs directly from the site's HTML print version (`story_print.php`, the page behind "Print / PDF") rather than converting the PDF, so text, italics and part structure come through cleanly and no PDF conversion step is needed.

- **Download stories by link…**: paste story links, bare story ids, or list pages (author, tag, category, archive), one per line.
- **Search by tag…**: browse the site's tag list with a filter box, check tags, choose *any* or *all* matching, then tick the stories you want. Click **★ Toggle favorite** on a highlighted tag to save it; favorites sort first, can be filtered with *Favorites only*, and **Check all favorites** selects them in one click. Favorites and the cached tag list live in Calibre's plugin settings (`Refresh tag list` re-reads the site).
- **Multi-part stories**: all parts of a story are one download. They become chapters of a single EPUB, with a table of contents (Author's Note, Part 1, Part 2…). Tick **Combine everything into one book** to merge several separate stories (for example, a series of related titles or a tag search) into one omnibus EPUB with one nested contents entry per story.
- Imported books get title, author, site tags and category as Calibre tags, the site summary as the comment, publisher *Metabods*, and a `metabods:<story id>` identifier. **Skip stories already in this library** uses that identifier, so repeat runs do not duplicate (combined books carry no identifier, so they are not detected as duplicates).

Notes and limits: requests are throttled to about one per second and run in a background thread with a Cancel button; stories fetched before a cancel are still imported. Images, scripts and most inline styling in story text are dropped; basic formatting (italics, bold, line breaks, indents, centering) is kept. Stories are copyrighted by their authors and marked "not to be reposted without permission", so this is meant for personal reading copies. No cover image is added; use Calibre's *Generate cover*.

Tested: parsing and EPUB construction against the live site (30 random stories plus a 50-part story, all well-formed EPUBs), the list/tag parsers, and 10 offline unit tests (`python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_metabods.py -v`). **Not tested inside Calibre itself**: the dialogs, the Calibre library import and the menu were only import-checked against stubs, because Calibre was not available in the build environment. The Calibre calls used (`add_books`, `all_field_for`, `JSONConfig`) were checked against Calibre's source on GitHub.
