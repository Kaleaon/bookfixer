# Metabods Downloader

Install: download the ZIP from the [main page](../README.md), then in Calibre choose **Preferences → Plugins → Load plugin from file**, pick it, restart Calibre, and add its button under **Preferences → Toolbars & menus** if it is not visible. Calibre 6 or newer.

Built with `python build_plugins.py` from the repository root (see *Building and testing* on the [main page](../README.md)).

Stories are copyrighted by their authors, and the sites ask that they not be reposted, so this is meant for personal reading copies. Requests are throttled and run in a background thread with a Cancel button; whatever was fetched before a cancel is still imported. No cover is added (use Calibre's *Generate cover*).

It builds EPUBs directly from the site's HTML print version (`story_print.php`, the page behind "Print / PDF") rather than converting the PDF, so text, italics and part structure come through cleanly and no PDF conversion step is needed.

- **Download stories by link…**: paste story links, bare story ids, or list pages (author, tag, category, archive), one per line.
- **Search by tag…**: browse the site's tag list with a filter box, check tags, choose *any* or *all* matching, then tick the stories you want. **★ Toggle favorite** saves a highlighted tag; favorites sort first, can be filtered with *Favorites only*, and **Check all favorites** selects them in one click. Favorites and the cached tag list live in Calibre's plugin settings (*Refresh tag list* re-reads the site).
- **Multi-part stories**: all parts of a story are one download and become chapters of a single EPUB with a table of contents. **Combine everything into one book** merges several separate stories into one omnibus EPUB with one nested contents entry per story.
- Imported books get title, author, site tags and category as Calibre tags, the site summary as the comment, publisher *Metabods*, and a `metabods:<story id>` identifier, which **Skip stories already in this library** uses to avoid duplicates. Combined books carry no identifier.
- Images, scripts and most inline styling are dropped; italics, bold, line breaks, indents and centering are kept.
